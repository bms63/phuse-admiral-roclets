## ABSTRACT

R package function documentation is singular in open source.  Detailed argument definitions coupled with inline examples can help breakdown complicated functions that help solve problems.  In admiral, R package for ADaMs, we have always prided ourselves on top-notch function documentation.  However, as the examples grew for each function the documentation became unwieldy.  Using the roxygen package, a key component of any R package, we extended the roclets to better display and curate the examples.  This presentation/paper will discuss the technical details of how we extended the roclet and how this positively impacted our function examples.

## INTRODUCTION

To set the stage, we will need to first discuss what is an R package and some of the
infrastructure behind it.  We will then pivot to discuss packages that help with the
package development process, i.e. roxygen2, devtools, usethis and then briefly discuss
the admiral package.

### R Packages

R packages are fundamental extensions to the R statistical programming language, bundling together code, data, documentation, and tests in a standardized format. They allow users to share and reuse code easily, greatly expanding R's functionality and driving its widespread adoption in data science. Creating an R package typically involves using development packages like devtools and usethis to set up the necessary directory structure. You then add your R functions to the R/ directory, write documentation for them using `roxygen2` comments, and declare any package dependencies in the DESCRIPTION file. After iterating through the process of generating documentation, testing your package, and building and installing it for use and sharing, you will submit it to a package repository like CRAN.

### roxygen2 package

The roxygen2 R package simplifies the process of documenting R code within packages. It allows developers to write documentation directly alongside their function definitions using special comments, known as roxygen comments, which start with #'. This approach keeps code and documentation co-located, making updates more efficient. roxygen2 then processes these comments to automatically generate .Rd files, which are the standard R documentation files, and also manages the NAMESPACE file and the Collate field in DESCRIPTION. This automated generation eliminates the need to manually write complex .Rd files, significantly streamlining package development. Beyond .Rd files, it also helps to manage the NAMESPACE file and other package metadata, simplifying the overall package development workflow. This system dramatically reduces the effort required for documentation, making it easier for users to understand and utilize package functions.

Below we have a brief example of a function add_numbers() with its roxygen document. Note that
the package is called roxygen2 while we refer to process as just roxygen or roxygenize.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#' Add two numbers together.
#'
#' This function takes two numeric inputs and returns their sum.
#'
#' @param x A numeric value, the first number.
#' @param y A numeric value, the second number.
#' @return The sum of `x` and `y`.
#' @examples
#' add_numbers(5, 3)
#' add_numbers(10, -2)
add_numbers <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

Let's take a quick look at each of roxygen sections/tags:

* #' Add two numbers together - serves as the title for the function.
* #' This function takes two numeric inputs and returns their sum -  is the description of the function.
* @param x A numeric value, the first number - describes the first parameter, x.
* @param y A numeric value, the second number - describes the second parameter, y.
* @return The sum of x and y. - describes what the function returns.
* @examples provides executable R code demonstrating how to use the function

The focus of this paper will be on enhancing the abilities of the @examples tag.

### admiral package

The admiral R package is an open-source, modularized toolbox specifically designed for creating Analysis Data Model (ADaM) datasets within the R environment. These ADaM datasets are a mandatory component for regulatory submissions, such as New Drug Applications, to health authorities like the FDA. admiral provides a collection of reusable R functions that enable the programming community to develop CDISC-compliant ADaM datasets in a standardized and efficient manner. It promotes a "building block" approach, allowing users to combine modular functions for deriving new variables and parameters, thereby minimizing redundancy and enhancing reproducibility. The package is part of the broader pharmaverse initiative, fostering collaboration among pharmaceutical companies and streamlining the use of R for clinical trial data programming.

admiral has a a lot of functions to do many different derivations for ADaMs. Many functions
need to be flexible to account for different scenarios, filtering or dirty data. As there
are many functions with a lot of flexibility there will also be many examples. Finding
a way to organize these functions in a way that helps a user if paramount to admiral's
mission.  

## R PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION

A lot of R packages have amazing documentation with great examples. However, as
a package grows in the number of functions the documentation will also grow. If
you package's function is developed in a way that the functions are flexible, then
you will need to showcase this flexibility with examples. To first introduce this problem
with a simple example, we will look at  dplyr R package looking at the arrange()
function.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html#ref-examples
```

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="dplyr_ex.png" alt="Alt text" width="600px">
</div>

The arrange() function has limited arguments, but is very versatile and has several long
examples! In the screenshot above, the two red arrows on the left are to highlight where 
the use of the function changes for the examples.  The red arrow on the right highlights the 
how to get access to the examples. When you click the link it will take you to the top of the examples.  


## ADMIRAL DOCUMENTATION

The admiral R package followed a similar pattern as dplyr before the release of 
1.3.0. In the next section, we will look at the same function derive_vars_dt() for
how the examples changed from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0.  The derive_vars_dt() function derives
a date from a date character vector with the ability to do imputation.


### derive_vars_dt() at 1.2.0

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="admiral_1_2.png" alt="Alt text" width="600px">
</div>

The pattern of red arrows is similar to the dplyr arrange function.  The left side
two red arrows have comments inserted to show the how the function can be used
to do different imputations.  The right side red arrow has the link for the examples.
When you click the link it will take you to the top of the examples.  

### derive_vars_dt() at 1.3.0

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="admiral_1_3.png" alt="Alt text" width="600px">
</div>

Now we are cooking! The example for derive_vars_dt() has a title for it followed by
a detailed description as evidenced by the red arrows on the left side.
On the right side, we can see a "Table of Contents" outlined for each example. The
examples are also clickable - so you can go to any example by just a click!

Let's dive into how we did this, by first exploring the new roxygen tags and then
get more into the code that generates the new roxygen examples.

### admiral on roxygen steorids - overview

Unfortunately, showcasing the derive_vars_dt() new roxygen layout would take up a few pages
so we will use a reduced version from the admiral developer documentation to illustrate
its enhanced abilities.

```{r}
#' @examplesx
#'
#' @caption Showcasing the first functionality of `fun()` (`arg1`)
#'
#' @info This is the detailed text for the first example.
#'
#' @code
#'
#' fun(arg1 = TRUE)
#'
#' @caption Showcasing the second functionality of `fun()` (`arg2`)
#'
#' @info This is the detailed text for the first example.
#'
#' @code
#'
#' fun(arg2 = FALSE)

```

First, notice the use of a new roxygen tag @examplesx, which extends the abilities of the
original @examples.  Once @examplesx is declared in it open up the following tags:
@caption, @info, @code. These new tags allow for clear titles to be declared, @caption,
with detailed descriptions using @info and write specific code after the @code tag. You
can repeat this pattern to showcase many examples. 

### admiral roxygen behind the sences - details

The admiral R package has a dependency package called admiraldev, which houses 
utility functions not needed by the user to do ADaM derivations. The rdx_roclet function within
admiraldev extends the standard rd roclet, meaning it performs its own custom processing first, 
and then delegates to the standard rd roclet to finish generating the .Rd file. 
This allows it to introduce new Roxygen tags and modify how existing information 
is presented. The roxygen2 package has a great article on extending the roclet which
is recommended reading - https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/extending.html.

Let's try and break down how the rdx_roclet related functions work to produce the 
extended roxygen abilities. Note this is a high-level overview and readers are enouraged
to explore the https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiraldev/blob/main/R/roclet_rdx.R

@examplesx (marks the beginning of the Examples Section)

**Purpose:** To explicitly mark the beginning of the examples section. It's largely a structural tag and can often be omitted if the first example-related tag is @caption.

**Processing:** The transform_examplesx function processes custom Roxygen tags like @caption, @info, and @code to generate structured examples. It groups these tags, executes the R code provided by @code (including capturing its output and handling expected conditions), and then combines this information into a single examplex tag for the R documentation, effectively transforming descriptive and executable components into a cohesive example. Crucially, it also cleanses the executed code's output of problematic Unicode characters to prevent LaTeX compilation errors in the final PDF manual.

@caption (Example Title)

**Purpose:** To provide a descriptive title or caption for a specific example within the examples section.

How it works: Each @caption begins a new example block. The text following @caption becomes the title.

**Processing:** transform_examplesx() collects the caption. In the final .Rd output, this becomes a \subsection{} within the main \section{Examples}{}.

@info (Example Description)

Purpose: To provide additional descriptive text or context for an example, explaining what it demonstrates or any specific considerations.

How it works: Placed after @caption and before @code, it contains the explanatory text.

Processing: transform_examplesx() appends this text to the contents of the current example block.

@code (Executable Example Code)

Purpose: To provide the actual R code for an example. Critically, this code is executed during the R package check process, and its output is included in the documentation.

How it works: The R code follows the @code tag. It can also include an optional argument [expected_cnds = "warning"] to indicate that certain conditions (like warnings or errors) are anticipated from the code and should not cause the check to fail.

Processing:

transform_examplesx() extracts the code and any expected_cnds options.

It then calls the execute_example() function.

execute_example() runs the R code in a controlled environment, captures its output (what R would print to the console), and any messages, warnings, or errors.

If an unexpected condition occurs (i.e., a warning or error not listed in expected_cnds), it will throw an error, causing the R CMD check to fail. This ensures that examples are not only documented but also correct and functional.

It also performs string replacements on the output (e.g., str_replace_all("\\u2139", "i"), str_remove_all("\\u200B")) to remove or convert Unicode characters that commonly cause issues when compiling the PDF manual using LaTeX. This directly addresses the type of LaTeX Error: Unicode character issue you encountered previously.

The captured code and its output are then formatted and included as part of the example's contents.


## CONCLUSIONS

This paper illustrates the critical role of clear and user-friendly messaging in enhancing software usability, particularly for new users navigating R programming. 
By leveraging tools such as the `cli` and `glue` packages, developers can craft error and warning messages that are not only informative but also engaging and supportive, as demonstrated through the `bmi()` function examples. 
The `admiral` package's approach to robust messaging exemplifies best practices, highlighting the importance of improving user communication to prevent confusion and facilitate troubleshooting. 
Additionally, the integration of snapshot testing and standalone scripts, as discussed in the paper, offers practical ways to maintain message consistency and reduce dependencies within R projects. 
Collectively, these strategies and tools contribute to a positive user experience, fostering a more productive and less frustrating interaction with software.
